      <h2>Your Spirituality & Success Is Here</h2>
      <p>Buddhism is an Indian religion based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha. Philosophical[1][2] and not theistic,[2] emerged in Ancient India as an ascetic tradition between the 6th and 4th centuries BC. It is currently the fourth largest religion in the world,[3] with over 520 million followers (about 7% to 8% of the global population),[4] known as Buddhists. In Brazil, according to the 2010 census, approximately 245,000 Buddhists reside.[5][6] In Portugal, there are around 64,000 Buddhists.[7] Buddhism encompasses diverse traditions, beliefs, and spiritual practices based on the Buddha's teachings and interpretations. The two major branches of Buddhism are theravāda ("School of the Elders" in Pali) and the mahāyāna ("The Great Vehicle" in Sanskrit).[8]</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As expressed in the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, the goal of Buddhism is the overcoming of suffering (dukkha) caused by desire and ignorance of the true nature of reality, formed by the impermanence and non-existence of the soul of living beings.[9] Most Buddhist traditions focus on overcoming the individual self through the attainment of nirvana or the pursuit of the Buddha way, which leads to the end of the cycle of death and rebirth.[10][11][12] Schools of Buddhism differ in their interpretations of the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of Buddhist texts, and especially their teachings and practices.[13][14] However, the foundations of all traditions and practices are the Three Gems: the Buddha (the master), the dharma (the teachings based on the laws of the universe), and the sangha (the Buddhist community).[15] Finding spiritual refuge in the Three Gems or Three Treasures is often what distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist.[16] Other practices include renouncing secular life to become a monk (bhikkhu) or nun (bhikkhuni), meditation, and the cultivation of paramitas.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Theravada Buddhism is widely followed in Sri Lanka and in Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand. The Mahayana tradition, which includes schools such as Zen (Chan), Pure Land, Nichiren, Shingon and Tendai (Tiantai), is more widespread in East Asian countries such as China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan. and Vietnam. The Vajrayana, a set of teachings that emerged in the tantric communities of India, can be seen both as a separate school of Buddhism and as an esoteric tradition of Mahayana Buddhism. Its greatest exponent, Tibetan Buddhism, is practiced in the Himalayan region (Bhutan, Nepal, Tibet and parts of India), in Mongolia and in the republics of Buryatia, Kalmykia and Tuva of the Russian Federation. In India, the most followed tradition is the Navayana ("New Vehicle" in Sanskrit), a neo-Buddhist movement founded by B.R. Ambedkar, who rejected the original doctrines of the Theravada and Mahayana traditions to interpret Buddhism through a class struggle bias. He inspired thousands of Dalits, members of the lowest caste in Hinduism, to convert to Buddhism.</p>
